Research Project for 8 hours.

1. from unembedding rep to deeper rep
2. looking at what happens with merged models



male -> female
hot -> cold
dark -> bright

near -> far
large -> small
old -> new
quick-> slow

pleasant-> unpleasant
symmetric -> asymmetric

hard -> easy
certain -> uncertain
significant -> insignificant
interesting -> boring

strong -> weak

natural -> artificial
