Blocks must be separated by [[Markov Blanket|Boundaries]] 

What is the relation between Boundaries and Compositionality?
Compositionality must be applicable at some Interface!

[[David Chalmes]] argues that [[Consciousness]] is the only known Strong Emergent Property
I think that Atoms / Chemical are much stronger candidates for Strong Emergent Levels, because most of the matter in the Universe is arranged, both spatially and temporally, according to those two levels!

Strong  = Back-Causal
Strong = Universal / Unavoidable  (and maybe even inevitable given enough time)
Strong = can't replace with some simpler, less novel set of Structures and get the same behavior of the lower-level

#### Critique of Strong Emergence
1. some argue that Strong Emergence is a useless conception because it only complicates things
	1. bullshit, imo, compositional abstract structures are the only way to explain many Multi-Particle Interactions
	2. also, this is literally how the entirety of science works - should be get back to planimetry from calculus?
	3. note: although this critique is called **Ontological Simplicity** - so maybe from [[Ontological Principle|Ontology (Philosophy)]] perspective it makes some sense? (not sure)
2.  [[Supervenience]] - that there is only a mirage of Causal Novelty, and in reality Pre-Emergent System can create the same distributions quite well 
	1. though if the distributions ***themselves*** are the SLE
