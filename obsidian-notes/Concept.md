#### Thinking about Meaning of Words
[[Embodied Agent|Embodiment]]
You can just randomly scan the text here and select any word and think of what it invokes in you.
1. You can of course think about other related words, and this is fine 
	1. you take a ***Categorical*** approach definitions - Relations are what defines the Concept
2. You can also remember [[Context]] in which you  ***first*** / ***mostly*** / ***recently*** (notice how <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">3 are distinct</mark>!) met the word
	1. $\text{would}$ - English lessons in 5th grade
	2. $\text{select}$ - SQL 
	3. $\text{think}$ - Barton Fink, Think-Tank 
	4. $\text{And}$ - Logical AND, End / Fin --? (vocal associations)
3. But if we want to steer from [[Self-Referential]] definitions we have to go to [[Multimodality|MultiModal]] World
	1. $\text{optimimal}$ - parabola, convex shape, minimum  (***Image***)
	2. $\text{specific}$ - <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Act of</mark> Looking and Selecting / <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Finding Anomaly</mark> / Picking one of many / Meditating on the Choice
	3. $\text{how}$ - <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Act of</mark> thinking Causally, constructing a Mechanistic Explanation, Observing, Hypothesising 

Thus we can hold the meaning of the Words in the ***Joint*** **[[Projection|Embedding]] Representational Space**  
But it is not true that based on word-to-word graph only we can not have Meaning behind the Words.
