Individuals in the flock can respond to a Predator faster then they can see it
Local propagation of Waves of Signals 

> [!note]
> This is similar to how [[Electricity]] actually works - Electrons do not really move all the way through the wire, they just push each other and this push is transmitted to the Resistence / Energy Converter

Point of Criticality - [[Phase Transition]] Point - it allows Collectives to have Telepathy-like behaviors

Going very close to a [[Phase Transition]] [[Critical Point]]  allows to position the system on the Edge of [[Chaos MOC|chaos]]
where we get maximized [[Sensitivity Analysis]] - system responds to signal much ***quicker*** and much ***easier***


Flocks and Schools are constructed by changing the ***Dynamic [[Graph Topology]]***

> [[LLM|LLMs]] must also be positioned on the points of Transitions / [[Phase Transition]] Points to do [[Behavior Switching]]!

[[Free Energy Principle|Active Inference]] vs classical Agent-Environment Set up
We add a layer of Attention?
Agent is not just affected by the environment, it chooses how it want to be affected to some  degree
by choosing on which parts of the incoming signal to concentrate

Prediction / Observation
Prediction - Observation = Surprise
Minimize the Surprise - make you Tick Prediction Model as strong as possible
Fight with the unpredictability of the World
Remaining regularized by your small brain 

Deviation from the Expectation 

How to Minimize Surprise:
1. you can move
2. you can change your predictive model

$1/2$ of flock wants to go red
$1/2$ of flock wants to go (blue) green
for some time they move along black - median
the angles of red vs black and green vs black start to raise
at some point angles reach [[Critical Point]] and the flock falls into a [[Bifurcation Point]]
the decision is:
1. will be continue to be a flock or will we go our separate ways?
	1. this is destruction of the Collective System: [[Desynchronization]] 
2. will we remain as a flock and go red or green?
	1. we can't go both directions
	2. we must pick one

Two energies fighting:
1. Attractive  Potential of Particles 
	1. some Global Energy raising from Multi-Particle System
		1. perhaps non-linearly from the number of Particles involved
	2. Smoothness? 
2. Individual Preference - go red or green
3. ? Maybe [[Repulsive Forces]] between individuals as well

Democracy in Swarms: 
by adding just $+1$ individuals, we get $95\%$ of chance to go with the Majority, [[Majority Vote Validation]]

This happens not despite the **Un-Informed** Individuals, but Thanks to the **Un-Informed** Individuals
