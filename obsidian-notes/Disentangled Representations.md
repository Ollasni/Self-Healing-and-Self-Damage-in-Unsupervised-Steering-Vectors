1. What is the relation with the [[Irreducible Representation]]? 
2. Disentangled $\simeq$ [[Orthogonality|Orthogonal]] $\simeq$ [[Independence|Independent]] $\simeq$ produced by [[Internal Direct Product (Group Theory)|Direct Product]]

![[Independence#Feature Independence]]


Even Linear Probing can combine Features!
It can be hard to disentangle two "Semantically Different" [[Feature]]s:

Disentangled [[Representation]]:
$$Red + Triangle = P(Color) \times P(Shape)$$
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Entangled</mark> Representation:
$$Red + Triangle = P(Color\times Shape)$$
> [!danger]
> In Entangled Representation we just <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">memorize all possible combinations</mark> as we would do in [[Predicate Logic]].

We want to get ***Concise*** ([[Computational Irreducibility|irreducible]]) [[First-Order Logic]] Representation
